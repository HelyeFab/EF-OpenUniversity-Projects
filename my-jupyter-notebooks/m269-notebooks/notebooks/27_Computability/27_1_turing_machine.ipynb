    "when we read a 1, we change the state from 'odd' to 'even' or vice versa.\n",

    "1. Skip the initial blank and change to state 'even' because\n",
    "   zero 1s have been read so far.\n",
    "1. Move right over any 0s and 1s, switching between the 'even' and 'odd' state\n",
    "   when reading a 1.\n",
    "1. When reading a blank, write 0 if the state is 'even', otherwise write 1,\n",
    "   because there's an odd number of 1s and so we need an extra 1.\n",
    "1. After writing the parity bit, move left and change to the 'back' state.\n",
    "1. Move left, skipping any 0s and 1s.\n",
    "1. Don't do anything when reading a blank:\n",
    "   this stops the machine with the head at the start of the tape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that an outline doesn't have to spell out all details.\n",
    "For example, I use the word 'skip' to indicate that the head moves\n",
    "over the symbols without changing them. However,\n",
    "when writing the algorithm as a transition table, we must always indicate\n",
    "the symbol written, the head movement and the new state.\n",

    "State | blank | 0 | 1\n",
    "-|-|-|-\n",
    "start | write blank, right, even  | |\n",
