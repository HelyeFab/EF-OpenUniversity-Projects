Whenever a patient calls for an appointment, Jan looks down the list until an empty line is found, and writes the patient's name in. Currently there are a number of problems with the system; if a Doctor overruns Jan just tries to remember where she is on the list and lets the next one in when the Doctor is ready. If a Doctor is done early and Jan notices the next person is there, she will let them in early. Sometimes she just waits until the next five minute mark and then calls the next name. Some people need double length sessions so she will put them down for two slots. She tends to scribble notes as she goes and copies these in the patient files at the end of the day if necessary. Sometimes emergency appointments come in; Jan will send them straight through if possible and note these into the book, but this tends to throw the timings off so she keeps the adjusted time in her head. \n",
